## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
In order to learn more about trading strategies, I have implemented several trading strategies, iteratively backtested them, and used the OANDA API to gather historical data.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
### iterativeBase.py
A base containing functions that can be used to assess performance of a given trading strategy. Funtionality of functions includes getting data, buying and selling instruments, and plotting data (among others). 

### strategies.ipynb
Implementation of trading strategies including Bollinger Bands, SMA, The Stochastic Oscillator, and Mean Reversion using RSI. Strategies are iteratively backtested, parameters can be optimised, and strategies can be combined.
